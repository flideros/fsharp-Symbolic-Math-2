# Symbolic Math 2

This is the second version of my personal coding lab for coding in f#. The previous lab depended heavily on packages, so in this version, I will try to keep the dependencies to a minimum. 

The **Symbolic Math** project is a work in progress. It will be a math engine for future WPF math controls. I will lean on my previos work for inspiration, but this library will designed from the ground up. 

The **Math Display** project is a work in progress. This project is a carry-over from my previous repository. The testing control is set to the test canvas. Run the project to see the WPF control(s) under development.

The **Math Lab UI** project is a minimal C# implementation to launch the WPF app. 

The **Math Lab** project is the main entry point to the lab. It is currently based on a tab control so the lab can host any arbitrary WPF content. All other F# controls I develop will use this project to launch from.

The **Basic Calculator** project is a carry over from the previous lab and one of the first WPF controls I have written.

The **Control Library** project is a collection of WPF controls and containers. It includes the **Color Picker** control which can be launched from the past projects tab of the Math Lab.

The **Database Lab** project is a utility app for connecting to and querying databases.

Feel free to clone this repository to code and test your own code or follow along as I grow this lab. 

Sincerely,

FLideros
