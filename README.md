# Symbolic Math 2

This is the second version of my personal coding lab for coding in f#. The previous lab depended heavily on packages, so in this version, I will try to keep the dependencies to a minimum. 

The **Math Lab UI** project is a minimal C# implementation to launch the WPF app. 

The **Math Lab** project is the main entry point to the lab. It is currently based on a tab control so the lab can host any arbitrary WPF content. All other F# controls I develop will use this project to launch from.

The **Basic Calculator** project is a carry over from the previous lab and one of the first WPF controls I have written.

The **Control Library** project is a collection of WPF controls and containers. It includes the **Color Picker** control which can be launched from the past projects tab of the Math Lab.

Feel free to clone this repository to code and test your own code or follow along as I grow this lab. 

Sincerely,

FLideros
